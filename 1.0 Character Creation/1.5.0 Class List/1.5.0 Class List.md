## 1.5.0 The Class List

The classes that follow are flavor-stripped versions of those found in **Worlds Without Number** and its supplement, **The Atlas of the Latter Earth**.
While mainstays such as the [Warrior]({% link 1.0 Chracter Creation/1.5.0 Class List/1.5.18 The Warrior.md %}), the [Expert]({% link 1.0 Character Creation/1.5.0 Class List/1.5.8 The Expert.md %}), and the [High Mage]({% link 1.0 Character Creation/1.5.0 Class List/1.5.10 The High Mage.md %}) are the most common, there are a few others that are more rare or unique.
A GM always has the right to omit classes that do not fit the flavor of the game they are running.
