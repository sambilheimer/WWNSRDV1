## 1.5.0 The Class List

The classes that follow are flavor-stripped versions of those found in **Worlds Without Number** and its supplement, **The Atlas of the Latter Earth**.
While mainstays such as the Warrior, the Expert, or the High Mage are appropriate to almost any fantasy setting, others may not fit specific campaigns.
A GM always has the right to omit classes that do not fit the flavor of the game they are running.
