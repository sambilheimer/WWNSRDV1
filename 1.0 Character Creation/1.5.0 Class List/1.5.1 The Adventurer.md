### 1.5.1 The Adventurer

Not every hero is perfectly reflected by one of the three main classes, even with the wide latitude of concepts each one allows.
For those heroes that straddle the roles, there remains the class of Adventurer.

An Adventurer picks two classes to reflect their own particular talents.
A spell-slinging swordsman might choose to be a Partial Mage/Partial Warrior, while a stealthy assassin might be a Partial Expert/Partial Warrior, and a grifting mountebank-wizard might be a Partial Expert/Partial Mage.
The player should pick whichever pairing serves best.

The tables below provide the hit dice, attack bonus, and [Foci]({% link 1.0 Character Creation/1.6.0 Foci.md %}) picks gained by each of the three possible pairings.
Thus, a first level Partial Expert/Partial Warrior would roll 1d6+2 for their hit points, have a +1 attack bonus, and pick three [Foci]({% link 1.0 Character Creation/1.6.0 Foci.md %}): one expert, one warrior, and one free pick.

Adventurers tend to have a wider range of abilities than a more focused PC, and the extra Focus pick can make a significant difference at low levels.
The absence of the strongest class abilities of Experts and Warriors make a difference in the longer run, however, and a Partial Mage will never attain the same magical power in their tradition as a focused specialist.

#### Partial Expert

A Partial Expert is treated just as a full Expert, including gaining the benefits of the **Quick Learner** ability.
They do not have the **Masterful Expertise** ability, however, as they lack the versatility of a full Expert.

#### Partial Mage

A Partial Mage is treated as a [Mage]({% link 1.0 Character Creation/1.5.0 Class List/1.5.12 The Mage.md %}), and gains the **Arcane Tradition** ability, allowing them to pick a magical tradition for their powers. That tradition’s abilities will be more limited for Partial Mages, however, as described under each of the paths.

It’s even possible for a PC to pick the Partial Mage class twice for two different magical traditions, gaining portions of both arcane powers.
They then use the usual full [Mage]({% link 1.0 Character Creation/1.5.0 Class List/1.5.12 The Mage.md %}) chart for hit dice, attack bonus, and [Foci]({% link 1.0 Character Creation/1.6.0 Foci.md %}), and the spellcasting table for dual casters if both partial classes cast spells.

A Partial Mage must adhere to the restrictions and limits of their magical tradition in order to use its abilities, regardless of whatever other partial class they may have.

#### Partial Warrior

A Partial Warrior gains certain of the benefits of a full Warrior, including the improved hit die and a somewhat improved attack bonus.
They do not have the **Veteran’s Luck** special ability or the **Killing Blow** power, however, and must trust to their own talents to land blows and crush their enemies.
