### 1.5.7 The Elementalist

Elementalists are spellcasting [Mages]({% link 1.0 Character Creation/1.5.0 Class List/1.5.12 The Mage.md %}) who focus on the manipulation of the material world around them.
While they are capable of using High Magic, their specialist spells focus chiefly on wielding the classical elements of fire, air, water, and earth.

#### Elementalist Benefits

All Elementalists gain Magic as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level-1 if was already level-0.

Elementalists can prepare and cast High Magic spells in addition to the spells specific to Elementalists.
As usual for spellcasters, Elementalists can’t cast spells or use arts while armored or holding a shield.

Elementalists are not as talented at general High Magic research as High Mages are, but their studies still bear fruit in time.
Each time they advance a level, they can pick a new High Magic spell or an Elementalist spell to add to their spellbook.
They must be able to cast the spell to add it to their selection.

Elementalists gain the **Elemental Resilience** and **Elemental Sparks** arts as part of their basic training, and may pick one additional art from the list below.
Further arts are learned as they advance in character level, as given in the tables below.
Once chosen, an art cannot be changed.

#### 1.5.7.1 Elementalist Arts

Elementalist Effort is calculated as usual, with each PC’s maximum being equal to one plus their Magic skill level plus the better of their Intelligence or Charisma modifiers.
Partial Elementalists have a score one point lower than this, albeit not less than one.

- **Elemental Resilience**: You are unharmed by mundane extremes of cold or by heat less than that of a furnace.
  You suffer only half damage from magical or extremely intense flame or frost attacks.
- **Elemental Sparks**: You can conjure petty amounts of flame, water, ice, stone, or wind, sufficient to do small tricks, chill drinks, light candles, or do other minor things.
  Conjured substances last no longer than a scene, and conjured water cannot lastingly quench thirst.
  This art cannot actually be useful in solving a problem or overcoming a challenge more than once per game session.

#### Other Elementalist Arts

- **Beckoned Deluge**: Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to conjure a considerable amount of water at a visible point with in fifty feet per caster level.
  This water is sufficient to drench one 10-foot cube of matter per character level, making non-magical bowstrings useless, extinguishing flames, and inflicting 1d6 dam age per caster level on fiery supernatural creatures.
  This water persists indefinitely after its conjuration and is sufficient to hydrate ten people per caster level.
- **Earthsight**: Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action.
  For the rest of the scene, you can see the outlines of solid objects even in perfect darkness, and can peer through a number of feet of earth or stone equal to your character level.
- **Elemental Blast**: Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to hurl a blast of some elemental force at a visible target within fifty feet per character level.
  The attack is made with Magic as the combat skill, Int, Cha, or Dex as the attribute, and a bonus to hit equal to your character level.
  It is not hindered by melee foes.
  On a hit, the attack does 1d6 damage plus your character level and attribute mod.
  The blast may have collateral effects on objects in the case of hurled fire or a torrent of pressurized water, but any conjured matter vanishes at the end of the round.
- **Flamesight**: Commit Effort as an On Turn action.
  While the Effort remains Committed, you can see thermal gradients sufficient to distinguish surfaces and living creatures, even in perfect darkness.
  Optionally, you may cause your own eyes to cast a light sufficient to illuminate your surroundings clearly out to a range of 30 feet.
- **Pavis of Elements**: Commit Effort as an On Turn action to conjure an elemental barrier around yourself.
  The barrier improves your Armor Class by +4 and remains as long as the Effort remains Committed.
  This bonus stacks with other effects, but cannot increase AC above 18, regardless of the combinations.
- **Petrifying Stare**: Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and target a visible creature.
  The creature must make a Physical save or become partially petrified, losing its Move action for a number of rounds equal to half your caster level, rounded up.
  Flying creatures are forced to land by this art and swimming creatures will inevitably sink to the bottom.
- **Rune of Destruction**: Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and target an adjacent solid surface.
  A glowing rune the size of a handprint forms on the surface and persists for one hour per caster level.
  Any creature who gets within two feet of the rune will trigger it, causing it to explode in a five-foot radius with an elemental force of your choice and suffering 2d6 damage plus your caster level.
  Creatures already within five feet of the rune when it is laid will not trigger it until they re-enter the area, nor will the caster trigger their own runes.
  Runes cannot overlap their areas of effect.
- **Steps of Air**: Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action and target a visible ally; for one round per caster level, the target can fly at their usual movement rate.
  If the art ends while they are still in the air, they descend harmlessly to the ground.
  This art may also be used as an Instant action to negate falling damage for any single target.
- **Stunning Shock**: Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and target a visible creature within fifty feet per caster level.
  The target creature must be wearing or holding at least a pound worth of conductive metal or be considerably dampened.
  An electrical bolt leaps from the caster to stun the target, causing them to lose their next Main Action.
  A Physical saving throw can mitigate the effect, causing the target to lose their Move action instead of their Main.
  A creature can be targeted only once per scene by this.
- **Thermal Shield**: Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action to immediately negate one instance of fire or frost damage to any single visible ally or object.
  This defense lasts only long enough to nullify the single instance of damage.
