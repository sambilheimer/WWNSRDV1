## 4.1.0 Spells and Arts

Magical invocations are known conventionally as **spells**, each one ranked in power from level one, the relatively weakest, to level five, the most potent.

The common corpus of ancient spells is known as High Magic.
These spells are the common heritage of all spellcasting mages, and any spellcasting mage can learn and use them.

Specific arcane traditions such as Elementalists or Necromancers also have bodies of spells specific to their tradition.
Only they can learn or cast these enchantments.

In addition to spells, mages commonly have access to **arts**, magical techniques that allow them to produce certain effects quickly and easily.
Most mages learn one or two arts as an apprentice and gradually master more as they advance in skill.

Every tradition has its own body of arts, and only members of that tradition can ever learn them.
Adventurers who take dual Mage classes can learn arts from both, but each class must choose its arts individually; a Partial High Mage/Partial Healer couldnâ€™t use his High Mage art picks to choose Healer arts, or vice-versa.
