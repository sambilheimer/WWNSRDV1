## 4.3.0 Dual Partial Spellcasters

Adventurers who take two different Partial Mage spellcaster classes use the table below to determine how many spells they can prepare and cast each day.
A dual Partial Mage can prepare and cast spells from either of their traditions.
PCs who pick one spellcaster partial and one non-spellcaster, like a Necromancer/Healer, do not use this table, but instead use the usual partial spellcaster table for their class.
