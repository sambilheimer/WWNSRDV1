## 4.4.0 High Magic Spells

Any spellcaster can learn and cast High Magic spells, albeit High Mages tend to have the arts best suited for enhancing and manipulating these sorceries.

View the [High Magic Spells by Name](4.4.0 High Magic Spells by Name) page for a list of spells by name.

### Apprehending the Arcane Form Level 1

The mage opens up their mind to the presence of occult energies.
For fifteen minutes per character level, they are capable of seeing active magical effects, curses, enchantments, or other dweomers as colored auras or patterns of light.
They may identify magical items and get a one-sentence description of their purpose or most significant powers, and may get more sophisticated answers with successful Wis/Magic skill checks at difficulties of 8 or more depending on the subtlety of the enchantment.
Mages with prepared spells are visible to the caster, though which spells the subject might have prepared is not knowable.
As a side effect of this spell, the ambient thaumic currents cast enough quasi-light to allow the caster to see normally even in perfect darkness.

### Cognitive Supersession of the Inferior Orders Level 1

The mage targets a visible, normal, non-magical animal or insect, obtaining temporary control of the beast and the ability to share its senses.
The animal gains a telepathic bond with the caster, obeying any non-suicidal command and allowing the mage to perceive everything it perceives.
The beast will not fight for the caster, but can perform complex actions entirely out of character for it while under the mage’s control.
The mage must focus to share the beast’s senses, requiring a Main Action and leaving the mage unable to act physically while so focused.
The spell lasts until the mage releases the beast, it is dispelled, or it is cast again.

### The Coruscating Coffin Level 1

A thaumic discharge is focused on a single visible creature within one hundred feet per caster level, wreathing them in a lethal mantle of crackling energy.
The target suffers 1d8 damage per caster level, with a Physical save for half.
NPC targets with only 1 hit die will inevitably be slain regardless of the damage done.
The spell cannot be blocked by non-magical intervening barriers, provided the caster can see the target with their unaided vision.

### Damnation of the Sense Level 1

The caster targets a visible creature within two hundred feet.
The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist; on a failure, one sense of the caster’s choice is entirely under the caster’s control for the rest of the scene, while a success leaves them bound only for the next round.
Any false impression may be given, or any true one concealed, and a creature may be left effectively blinded or deafened.
Distracting tactile sensations can force the victim to make a Physical saving throw in order to act each round.
Blinded creatures can’t make ranged attacks and roll all melee hit rolls twice, taking the worst result.
If a creature thinks itself in mortal peril its excitement allows it to make a Mental save to throw off the spell at the end of each round.

### Decree of Ligneous Dissolution Level 1

Wood, linen, cotton, rope, and other plant- or fungus-derived matter is annihilated by a wave of entropic force that washes through an area near the caster.
The mage targets a point within one hundred feet per caster level and designates a number of contiguous 10-foot cubes within that area equal to or less than their caster level.
All non-magical plant matter within that area immediately erodes away to dust.
Enchanted objects of plant matter cannot be affected, but ordinary plant-based clothing, bows, or wooden-hafted weapons will be destroyed.
If used against plant-based monsters, the spell does 1d10 damage per caster level, with a Physical save for half.

### The Excellent Transpicuous Transformation Level 1

The mage chooses up to one visible willing target per caster level provided they are within 100 feet, though afterwards the targets can separate freely.
The targets and all they wear or carry become perfectly transparent.
Missile attacks against invisible foes are largely impossible, and melee attacks against them usually suffer a -4 penalty to hit rolls.
The spell lasts for up to an hour per caster level, but it breaks if a subject performs some violent motion, such as running, attacking, or casting a spell.
Once broken for one subject, it breaks for all.

### Imperceptible Cerebral Divulgence Level 1

The mage focuses on a visible living creature within 100 feet per caster level.
For the rest of the scene, they immediately receive an impression of the target’s surface thoughts and interests, understanding them regardless of any lack of a shared language.
The caster may ask one question of the target’s memories per caster level, but doing so risks breaking the spell; the target can make a Mental save before answering each question and the spell ends if the save is successful.
These questions can only query memories, not compel any exercise of judgment or extrapolation.
This spell is very subtle in its casting, and can be invoked without any visible gestures or audible incantations.

### Ineluctable Shackles of Volition Level 1

The mage targets a visible living creature within 100 feet.
The subject must immediately make a Mental saving throw at a penalty equal to the caster’s Magic skill or become enthralled to the caster’s will.
Such victims will obey any physical commands issued by the caster, barring ones that seem suicidal or patently meant to result in their murder.
The caster cannot order the creature to answer questions or perform acts that require independent judgment, nor to use non-physical abilities or spells, but it will fight for the caster or to defend its own life.
En chanted victims appear torpid and dazed, and will act only to defend themselves or satisfy their needs.
The spell lasts until dispelled, or until the caster dies or releases them.
Every time this spell is cast, however, all prior subjects get an immediate unmodified Mental saving throw to throw it off.
If the creature has more hit dice than the caster, it gets an unmodified saving throw to end the effect the first time each day it’s ordered to do something it finds strongly objectionable.

### The Long Amber Moment Level 1

This spell may be cast as an On Turn spell, provided no other has been cast this round, and targets a single willing or helpless creature the caster is touching.
The subject is shifted out of the flow of conventional time, freezing and being limned in a pale sepia light.
They and all their carried possessions are rendered impervious to all non-magical harm and are frozen in temporal stasis until the spell ends or is dispelled.
Enchanted creatures are quite light, counting as only four items of Encumbrance due to their unwieldiness.
The spell ends when the mage releases it, or up to a maximum of one day per caster level.
If cast on himself, the mage cannot end it before the full duration expires.

### Phantasmal Mimesis Level 1

The mage creates a phantasmal seeming at a visible location with in 100 feet per caster level.
The illusion can occupy a number of 10-foot cubes equal to the caster’s level and can include visual, audible, olfactory, and even tactile elements.
If onlookers have no reason to believe the illusion is false, they will unconsciously move and perceive so as to conform to its apparent physical qualities, halting before walls, reeling from imagined blows, and seeing their clothing burnt by phantasmal flames.
The illusion will behave and act on its own in accordance with the caster’s intentions for it, but it cannot go more than a hundred feet from where it was conjured.
Phantasmal monsters fight with the caster’s hit bonus, do 1d8 damage, have AC 10, and vanish if struck.
There can be no more than one active illusionary attacker per two caster levels.
Foes brought to zero hit points fall unconscious and wake up ten minutes later with 1 hit point.
Creatures convinced the illusion is false can make a Mental saving throw each round to reject its psychic influences, becoming immune to its effects.
The illusion lasts until dispelled, the caster drops it, or this spell is cast again.

### Velocitous Imbuement Level 1

Unlike most spells, this one may be cast as a simple On Turn action, targeting up to one visible willing creature per caster level within one hundred feet.
Enchanted creatures become incredibly fleet of foot, doubling their usual ground movement rate and becoming capable of running up walls and across ceilings without falling, provided they end their round upright on a navigable surface.
They may also move away from melee opponents without needing to make a Fighting Withdrawal to avoid a parting attack, and may pass through and around armed foes who do not completely physically block their path.
The spell lasts for the remainder of the scene and adds 1 System Strain to those who take advantage of it.

### Wardpact Invocation Level 1

This spell may be cast in two different forms.
If it targets a creature within 200 feet, the target becomes partially immune to physical weapons; any weapon hit on them requires the attacker make a successful Physical save or the hit is negated.
This effect lasts for one round per two caster levels, rounded up, and can’t target the caster.
If it targets a visible weapon within two hundred feet, that weapon is rendered entirely harmless and unable to inflict damage for the rest of the scene, with no saving throw.
The spell may only affect a given target or weapon once per scene and natural body weapons aren’t affected.

### The Wind of the Final Repose Level 1

The mage designates a visible point within two hundred feet.
A silent, invisible burst of soporific influence erupts from that point, targeting all living creatures within a twenty-foot radius.
All such targets with 4 or fewer hit dice within that area fall unconscious instantly, and can be roused only by damage or by a Main Action used to kick them awake.
If not roused, they revive at the end of the scene.
Entities that do not sleep are immune to this spell.

### Calculation of the Evoked Servitor Level 2

This spell conjures up an intelligent familiar for the caster, one with one hit point per caster level, an AC of 14, a ground movement rate of 30’ per action, saving throws the same as the caster, a +0 skill modifier, and no effective attack.
The familiar always adopts the same shape for the same caster, though the initial casting can set this to any shape the caster wishes provided it’s no larger than a small human.
The familiar retains a telepathic connection with its creator and will obey any command it is given, including suicidal ones.
It can perform any action that a competent human servant could.
If the familiar is slain, it fades away, but can be called forth again by the spell.
The familiar retains its memories of what happens while it’s summoned, and can develop its own personality in time.
The familiar remains in existence until dawn following the spell’s casting or until dismissed by the caster.

### Casting Forth the Inner Eye Level 2

A pool of water, mirror, open flame, polished crystal, or other luminous or reflective surface is used to peer at a distant location.
The location must either be within one hundred feet per caster level or be a location the caster has physically occupied before.
The caster perceives the location as if he were standing at the targeted point within it, seeing and hearing events there as if he were present.
This spell cannot scry locations that have been magically warded, and scrying the same location repeatedly is hindered by the resonance created by the spell.
The spell cannot perceive the same area twice within the same week, or position its target point so as to overlap a prior area with its perceptions within that time.
If a target present in the area has more hit dice than the caster has levels, they get a Mental saving throw to get an uncanny sense of being watched, something that will alert those cognizant of this spell.
This spell lasts until the caster performs some action other than focusing on the scrying.

### Conjunction of the Inexorable Step Level 2

A visible target within a hundred feet is immediately teleported to any visible, solid resting point within a half-mile, provided the target point has enough room to accept them and it is not a position of imminent physical peril.
Unattended objects can be translocated by the spell, but they can be no larger than a horse.
Unwilling creatures targeted by this spell may make a Mental saving throw to resist; on a success, it is the caster who is transported to the intended destination instead.

### Decree of Lithic Dissolution Level 2

Stone, earth, sod, sand, or other largely mineral material is reduced to a faint spray of fine dust by this sorcery, though metal and enchanted objects are unaffected.
The caster nominates up to one contiguous 10-foot cube per caster level in a visible area within one hundred feet per caster level, causing all such stone or mineral material within the cubes to disappear.
Such rapid destruction may well cause larger structures to collapse as well.
If used against rock-based monsters, the spell does 1d10 damage per caster level, with a Physical save for half.

### Extirpate Arcana Level 2

The caster sweeps away all unwanted magical effects and enchantments within a twenty-foot radius, centered on any visible point within one hundred feet per level.
If the magical effect was cast by a creature with equal or fewer hit dice or levels, the effect is negated automatically.
Otherwise, a contested Int/Magic or Cha/Magic skill roll must be made, with higher-leveled caster gaining a +2 bonus on their roll and the dispeller winning any ties.
This spell is not strong enough to permanently suppress standing magical effects, and requires the aforementioned contested roll to have any chance to even temporarily suppressing them.
If successful, the effect is negated for 1d6 rounds.
If cast on a very large enchantment, only the portion within the spell’s zone of effect is suppressed.

### The Inexorable Imputation Level 2

The caster makes a single one-sentence statement as part of casting this spell, a process which is subtle enough to appear as no more than ordinary conversation.
All who hear the caster speak within a forty-foot radius must make a Mental saving throw or come to immediately believe the statement is true unless it seems physically impossible to them or it is emotionally intolerable to believe.
The listeners must be able to understand the caster’s language, and the caster may exempt up to two targets per caster level from this delusion when casting the spell, so as to avoid beguiling their companions.
The spell’s effects linger for one hour per caster level, after which the believers will be no more persuaded of the fact than events or their own common sense would allow.

### The Jade Palanquin of the Faceless God Level 2

This spell calls forth a floating palanquin of ornately-carved green stone.
A slim three-foot-tall statue of a faceless entity stands at the center of the platform, while four slender pillars rise at the corners, the roof and sides being draped by metallic golden cloth.
The palanquin itself is twelve feet long and eight wide, with room enough for several people to sit on it.
It floats at shoulder-height above the ground or a liquid surface below.
It does not move of its own, but may be pulled along by even one human-sized bearer.
The total burden on the palanquin cannot exceed more than two thousand pounds, or it sinks to the ground.
It lasts until dusk, dawn, or until the statue of the god is struck or insulted, whichever comes first.

### Mantle of Disjecting Dissection Level 2

A visible willing creature within thirty feet is surrounded by a whirl of razor-sharp energy shards.
Anyone who attempt to touch the target or make a melee attack against them must make an Evasion saving throw or suffer 1d6 damage plus the caster’s level before resolving their attack.
The field of blades is indiscriminate and will affect even allies trying to touch the target.
The blades remain as long as the target gives up a Move Action each round in order to avoid disrupting them from within, up to a maximum of one scene.

### Prudentially Transient Abnegation of Life Level 2

This spell may be cast as an Instant action, even if another spell has been cast the same round, and targets either the caster or a willing visible target.
It can only be used in immediate response to an injury that reduces the target to zero hit points.
When it does, the target suffers dramatic and ostentatiously obvious death, with mortal blows cleaving them asunder or gorily butchering them.
They are dead to all mundane or magical examination.
Up to two hours later however, at the target’s discretion, the various remains of the target flow back together and restore their body with two hit points per caster level and two additional System Strain points gained.
If the target’s remains are intentionally scattered widely, incinerated, or entirely eaten, however, they cannot revive.
The subject is aware of their surroundings while “dead”.

### Resounding Temporal Echo Level 2

The caster imbues one visible ally per caster level with a burst of tremendous speed as their localized time begins to flow more rapidly.
For 1d4+1 rounds, all subjects get an extra Main Action during their turn.
This Main Action may not be used to cast spells or use arts.
This spell severely taxes those who take advantage of it, adding 1 System Strain for each round in which the recipient takes the bonus action.

### The Verdant Vallation Level 2

A vast wall of thick, heavy vines and other plant life blooms from a visible point within one hundred feet per caster level.
The wall is up to twenty feet high and three feet thick and runs for as much as twenty feet in width per caster level.
The vine wall can be shaped as the caster wishes within the spell’s area of effect, so long as it’s contiguous, and may be laid horizontally if a bridge or roof is desired.
Enemies must inflict five hit points of damage per caster level to cut a man-sized hole in the vines, and they must be using weapons or means that could actually cut through a wooden wall to do any meaningful harm.
The vines may be optionally covered in long, vicious thorns to discourage climbing, inflicting 2d6 damage on any creature who tries to climb over it.
If the vine wall is summoned from earth that could plausibly support plant life, it remains until dispelled or until it dies naturally.
If called from bare stone or other infertile soils, it withers away to dust at the end of the scene.

### Visitation of the Clement Clime Level 2

The caster and up to three visible allies per caster level are shielded from the excesses of hostile elemental energies, becoming immune to mundane extremes of heat and cold and natural acids or electrical discharges.
Against magical harm of this nature, they automatically take only half the damage they normally would, or none if they make a successful Physical saving throw.
This spell lasts for one hour per caster level.

### Adopt the Simulacular Visage Level 3

A brief incantation transforms one visible, willing target per caster level into a perfect simulacrum of any humanoid creature the caster has seen before, whether a specific individual or a general type.
No special abilities are granted by this transformation, but the target will perfectly resemble a chosen individual, including in voice and scent.
Their non-magical clothing will transform to whatever clothing is appropriate to the target, and they will gain an intuitive ability to speak and understand the target’s native tongue.
The spell lasts until dawn of the day after casting it, whereupon the targets and any transformed clothing revert back to their original seeming.

### Conjunct the Vital Viscera Level 3

The caster renders the forms and life energy of up to one visible subject per caster level into something plastic and transferable.
Hit points, poisons, and diseases can be transferred from one creature to another, if both are willing or helplessly bound, healing up to the maximum allowed hit points of the target creature.
Body parts can be exchanged or gifted so long as each subject retains at least half of their original corpus.
A willing target can even be absorbed into the body of another subject of the spell, disappearing into them until the spell ends or they choose to spring back out, fully-equipped.
As similated subjects can continue to see and hear what goes on outside their carrier.
A given subject can absorb up to five other human-sized targets.
The spell lasts until dispelled, released, or one hour per caster level has passed, though transferred hit points or afflictions do not return to their original subject.
If a subject is killed while “borrowing” another’s body parts, those parts do not return.

### Exhalation of Congelating Cold Level 3

The caster invokes a gust of deepest winter on a point within one hundred feet per level, freezing everything in a radius up to ten feet per caster level.
All liquids freeze solid down to a depth of two feet and all living creatures not impervious to arctic cold must suffer 1d6 damage per two levels of the caster, with a Physical save for half damage.
Those who fail their Physical saves are numbed by the cold and lose their Move action each round for the next 1d4 rounds.
The frozen area warms again at the usual rate for the surrounding environment.

### Foresightful Apprehension Level 3

The caster probes the near currents of fate to discern the likely immediate outcome of an action.
The caster describes a particular action they or a comrade intend to presently undertake, whereupon the GM tells them what is most likely to happen in consequence within the first five minutes after the action, as the GM thinks it most probable.
This spell cannot be used more than once a week on the same general topic.

### The Glass Chimes of the Bamboo Terrace Level 3

This spell calls forth a floating set of colored glass chimes.
The caster alone may strike them, producing sounds of great subtlety and penetration.
The caster may allow anyone in the desired range to hear the music, or may make it inaudible to anyone save specific targets within range.
Such is the expressiveness of the chimes that those who hear them may instantly understand the caster’s desired message, however abstract.
If the caster strikes the chimes violently as a Main Action, they may shatter them, causing a deafening clamor that does 3d6 damage to all non-deaf targets within forty feet except for the caster.
The maximum range of the chimes is ten miles per caster level, and they persist until shattered or the scene ends.

### The Howl of Light Level 3

A flattened disc of tremendous heat, sound, and shock is triggered at a visible point within fifty feet per caster level, erupting in a twenty-foot radius eight feet in height.
Everything within the area suffers 1d8 damage from flame, concussion, and sonic shock per caster level, with an Evasion save for half.
If used in a space less than 40 feet in width, the explosion is channeled through adjacent spaces and passages for an additional 1d6 x 10 feet.

### Phobic Storm Level 3

A wave of numbing terror sweeps over all enemies of the caster within forty feet.
They must immediately make a Morale check at a -1 penalty, with failure causing flight.
Those who succeed at the check suffer one point of damage per caster level from demoralization and despair, with those brought to zero hit points instead regaining one hit point and fleeing.
This spell has no effect on creatures that feel no fear or that have a Morale of 12.

### Scorn the Fetters of Earth Level 3

The caster and up to one visible ally per caster level are briefly grant ed the ability to move in three dimensions, being able to walk and run upward into the air as easily as along flat ground.
For the rest of the scene, those affected can move in such a way, remaining suspended in the air after their movement for the round.
When the spell ends, either naturally or upon being dispelled, all affected targets float gently to the ground.
Optionally, the caster can instead use this spell on one visible flying creature per caster level, which must make a Physical save at a penalty equal to the caster’s Magic skill or be forced to land as they had fallen half the distance they had descended.
For the rest of the scene, such creatures remain grounded and unable to fly.

### The Torment of Tumefaction Level 3

A single visible living creature is smote with a hideous curse of torment.
Boils erupt all over their body, blood weeps from their orifices, tumors engorge their flesh, and all of their hair falls out almost instantaneously.
If they perform any vigorous physical action save movement they incur two points of damage per caster level from the effects of the curse, damage which can be suffered no more than once per round by a target.
A creature may spend its Main Action to attempt a Physical save to throw off the curse and return to a glabrous normalcy, but on a failure, the curse remains for the rest of the scene.
If the creature has fewer hit dice than the caster has levels, a single failed save means the curse lasts indefinitely, until dispelled or until the caster releases them.

### Touch of Elucidating Intangibility Level 3

The caster touches a solid non-magical barrier when casting this spell.
A 10 foot cube of the barrier then becomes perfectly transparent on the caster’s side, allowing them to see and hear whatever lies on the other side as if it were well-lit and visible.
Optionally, the caster may make the barrier insubstantial for one round per caster level, allowing anyone to pass or shoot through it from either side.
The barrier always appears solid and opaque from the other side, even while the caster is peering through.
If someone is caught within the barrier when it becomes solid again, they’re spat out on the nearest clear side and suffer 2d10 damage.
The spell ends when the caster ceases to touch the barrier or immediately after it has been made insubstantial.

### Vallation of Specified Exclusion Level 3

The caster must form some sort of line as part of this spell’s invocation, either with dropped powders or a trace drawn in the dirt or a more permanent inlay into a floor.
In extremis, the caster can make such a line as part of a Move action, tracing it out or scattering powder as they go.
The line itself may be no longer than twenty feet per caster level, and may be straight or curved as the caster wishes.
Once it has been drawn, this spell may be cast, empowering the line with the ability to ward off a particular target and prevent them or their powers from crossing or being made to cross the line, as if it were a physical wall.
The caster can nominate any kind of target to be warded that could be distinguished without need for knowing their thoughts, such as “humans” or “non-humans” or “men wearing the livery of the baron”.
The barrier extends a hundred feet upward and ten feet downward and blocks any attack or magical power used by those warded.
If the excluded creatures are attacked or targeted by powers from the other side of the barrier, however, the entire field shatters.
The barrier lasts until dispelled, the caster drops it, or until one hour has passed per caster level.

### Calculation of the Phantasmal Eidolon Level 4

The caster conjures up a semi-real phantasmal creature in any shape or appearance they desire, provided it is no larger than an ox.
The servitor is as intelligent as a human and will obey the caster with fear less and suicidal devotion, having 4 effective hit dice, 20 hit points, AC 15, a movement rate of 30’ per action, a +1 skill modifier, saves of 13+, and a +6/1d8 damage melee attack with 2/AC 15 Shock.
As the creature is partly phantasmal, the damage it inflicts cannot kill a subject, but only knock them unconscious for an hour before they awaken with 1 hit point.
The caster may pick one special quality for the creature when it is summoned: the ability to fly at a rate of 30’/move, the perfect duplication of a particular person they’ve seen, the ability to form a telepathic speech connection with the caster, or the ability to effectively use normal weaponry and armor.
The servitor lasts until destroyed or the dawn after the spell is cast.

### Contingent Excision of Arcana Level 4

The caster sets up a triggered resonance of dispelling magic which may later be invoked as an Instant action.
Until the next dawn, the mage may negate magic as if with an **_Extirpate Arcana_** spell as an Instant action.
Once this negation is triggered, the spell ends.

### Disjunctive Temporal Reversion Level 4

The caster may invoke this spell as an Instant action on any single creature within one hundred feet.
Time is rolled back slightly, allowing them to replay their current round of action as if it never occurred, though all involved retain a memory of what originally happened.
This spell is only useful on targets that are currently taking their round’s actions; once they’ve finished for the round and another creature has started acting, it is too late to benefit from this spell.
If the target is unwilling to roll back their action, they may make a Mental saving throw to resist the spell.

### Evert the Inwardness Level 4

A single visible target is selected, whereupon whatever contents that target may possess are extracted and placed in the caster’s hands.
If used on a cabinet, backpack, pocket, or other such container it can be no larger than an armoire, and the caster can choose whether or not to receive any particular object from inside it, being instantly appraised of its contents when the spell is cast.
If used on a creature, it attempts to tear out the subject’s innards; if the subject has equal or fewer hit dice than the caster, it must make a Physical save or die instantly.
Whether or not it perishes, it suffers 1d10 damage per caster level, with a Physical save for half.

### The Grinding Geas Level 4

A single visible living creature is struck with a grim geas, forcing it to comply with a particular command or else suffer a progressively-worse affliction.
The caster may lay one single-sentence command on the target that is neither suicidal, indefinitely imprecise, nor likely physically impossible for them to comply with.
Thus, the caster could geas a man to kill his son or never seek to harm his lord, but he could not reasonably command a peasant to become king or bind someone to forever after comply with a master’s arbitrary commands.
If the target then defies that geas or unreasonably delays its execution, they suffer an agonizing progressive wasting disease that will inevitably kill them in 1d6 weeks, applying -2 to their hit rolls and -1 to skill checks for each week that passes and halving their maximum hit points.
If they again begin complying with the geas afterwards or if the curse is lifted, the disease halts and reverses itself at the same rate it progressed.
An active target can make a Mental save to resist this spell, but they cannot if they are restrained, unconscious, or otherwise subdued.
The curse lasts until dispelled or the caster lifts it.

### Obnubilation of the Will Level 4

This spell can only be applied to a helpless or restrained living victim, who gets a Mental saving throw to resist it and be forever after immune to its effects.
On a failure, the target becomes hopelessly subject to the caster via a series of psychic fetters, obediently carrying out their will.
The target must be able to understand the caster’s wishes, but will obey them to the best of its intelligence, capability, and initiative.
They must make a Mental saving throw to resist performing even suicidal acts.
The spell lasts until it is dispelled or the caster releases the target.
A caster can have no more creatures under this spell than twice their level or hit dice; if this number is exceeded, the earliest thrall is freed first.
Creatures under the effect of the Obnubilation of the Will display numerous small tics and magically-compelled quirks of behavior that may provoke puzzlement in casual observers and will give away the mental influence entirely to an onlooker with at least Magic-0 skill who can observe them for at least an hour.

### The Ochre Sigil of Juxtaposition Level 4

This spell is cast in two parts, each of which must be cast separately within a mile of each other, though such paired use counts as only a single spell slot.
The first casting inscribes a palm-sized seal of ruddy brown radiance on the ground beneath the caster.
The second casting will immediately switch the caster and all creatures and objects within ten feet with all creatures and objects within ten feet of the sigil.
The caster may refrain from swapping certain targets as they wish.
Only portable objects are swapped; any object too heavy for the caster to lift or secured in place remains unmoved.
Unwilling targets get no saving throw if they have four or less hit dice; others can make a Mental save.
Unused sigils dissipate in a day.

### Pierce the Pallid Gate Level 4

The caster opens a short-ranged spatial rift between two points within one hundred feet per level, provided they can see or have physically occupied both points at some prior time and provided the two points are at least twenty feet apart.
The rift forms a gateway that connects the two points, one large enough to drive a cart through, and allows subjects on either side to see through and pass through the gate.
Ambient environmental qualities such as liquids or atmospheres will not pass through the portal; only intentionally-directed creatures and objects will transfer.
Once the creature has passed through a portal, it cannot pass through again until its next turn.
The portal remains open for up to one round per caster level, but can be shut as an Instant action by the caster.
Creatures partially in a rift when it closes are spat out on the far side.

### Sigil of Aeolian Auctoritas Level 4

A fierce gust of wind may be conjured in a line a hundred feet long and thirty feet wide.
All creatures of man-size or smaller must make Physical saves or be bowled over and blown back thirty feet, losing their next round’s Main Action and suffering 1d6 damage.
Light wooden constructions or similar structures are flattened by the wind.
If used outdoors, the spell can instead control the local weather, transforming the quarter-mile around the caster into any climate found normally at that location at any point during the year.
The spell cannot summon a tornado or other extreme weather, but it can call rain and conventional storms sufficient to cause flooding in areas prone to it.
The gust of wind is instantaneous, but the weather change lasts for one hour per caster level before reverting to its natural state.

### Abdication of Temporal Presence Level 5

The caster and up to one visible ally per caster level briefly step outside of the conventional flow of time, the rest of the world freezing around them.
These subjects can take 1d4+1 free rounds of actions, but they cannot physically affect the world or move any object they were not carrying at the time they cast the spell.
Any spells the caster or other allies cast can affect only their own group, and not those entities still in the normal flow of time.

### Banishment to the Black Glass Labyrinth Level 5

Aimed at a visible point within three hundred feet, the spell affects all creatures except the caster within a ten-foot radius of the target, translating them into a lightless extradimensional maze of endlessly tall obsidian walls.
The maze is infinite, featureless, and empty.
Transported creatures get a Mental saving throw to end the spell, re-appearing one round after it was cast.
Those who fail their save get to make an additional attempt once an hour afterwards.
Creatures with five or fewer hit dice cannot attempt these saving throws and are trapped forever unless the mage is killed or ends the spell.
Time passes normally while trapped, and creatures snared within may rest, fight, or starve as their situation and wills so recommends.
Dead or escaped creatures appear in the nearest clear space to their original departure.

### The Dazzling Prismatic Hemicycle Level 5

A blinding fan of impossible colors cascades over all targets in front of the caster in an area equal to a cone a hundred feet long and a hundred feet wide at the end.
Each creature within that area must make a Physical saving throw; those who fail roll 1d6.
On a 1, they are unharmed, on a 2 they collapse into a handful of dust, on a 3 they fall unconscious for an hour, on a 4 they go violently insane for the next hour and attack all around them, on a 5 they turn to stone, and on a 6 they become utterly enthralled to the caster’s commands for the next hour, as if under the effect of an Ineluctable Shackles of Volition spell.

### Deluge of Hell Level 5

The caster unleashes a consuming destruction on a visible point within three thousand feet.
A torrent of eldritch ruin rains down from the heavens on everything within up to a two hundred foot radius per caster level, inflicting 1d8 damage per caster level with a Physical save for half damage, and automatically killing all targets with 4 or fewer hit dice.
This damage is sufficient to destroy any wooden or lightly-built stone structure and will seriously damage even fortifications.
The caster can tighten the radius down to a minimum of 20 feet, but cannot be selective about targets within that area, This spell cannot be cast indoors, and is extremely hazardous to the caster; they must make a Mental saving throw on casting it or suffer a quarter of the damage inflicted, rounded up.

### The Earth as Clay Level 5

The caster molds the soil and stone of the land around them, raising hills, digging trenches, or forming simple structures out of extruded bedrock.
Once cast, the mage may psychically mold the terrain within three hundred feet per caster level, shifting it slowly over the course of an hour to form whatever shape they desire out of it, provided the material used can actually maintain such a shape.
Simple buildings and walls may be created out of bedrock or available stone, and tunnels and caves may be shaped up to 50 feet down from the caster, while hills may be raised up to 200 feet above the prevailing grade.
This spell cannot work within a thousand feet of stone or earth that has been significantly worked by intelligent creatures, though the use of this spell by the same caster doesn’t count as working the earth on further castings.

### Invocation of the Invincible Citadel Level 5

The caster hurls up a magical shield that is impervious to almost all hostile powers.
Unlike most sorceries, this spell can be cast as an Instant action, and immediately creates a transparent bubble of force around the caster with up to a twenty-foot radius.
Entities and forces outside the bubble cannot penetrate it, and the interior remains a warm, breathable, safe environment regardless of the exterior.
Those within the bubble can pass out of it, but they cannot then return within.
The bubble can be dispelled by appropriate magics, but other enchantments and attacks cannot harm it, nor can magical effects or material objects pass through it from either direction.
The spell lasts until the caster departs from the bubble.

### Open the High Road Level 5

The caster carves open a metadimensional gate between their present location and a preset target point.
Attuning the target point requires an hour of effort, after which this spell will open an opaque portal to it from a distance of up to one hundred miles per caster level.
The portal is large enough to admit a cart and wagon and will remain open for up to one minute per caster level, ending when they pass through it.
The gate is one-way only, from caster to target.
Only living creatures and the vehicles they drive and objects they carry may pass through; atmosphere and other environments remain on the far side of the gate.
Only one target point may be prepared for this spell at a time, and there is a 1-in-10 chance for every casting that the real destination is 1d100 miles in a random direction, discovered only after the portal is used.
