## 5.2.0 Reaction Rolls and Parleying

These rules do not encourage constant combat encounters. Heroes are fragile, foes are dangerous, and almost every fight runs some risk of downing at least one PC. GMs or players who arrange their games as a curated sequence of battles are going to rapidly run out of luck.

GMs need to constantly recall the fact that not every hostile en counter needs to end in a massacre. The denizens of this world are just as aware of their own mortality as the PCs are, and they will not pick chance fights that they do not expect to win decisively. Even intrinsically hostile creatures will take a moment to size up a situation.

Unless the situation is so patently destined for bloodshed that all negotiation is futile, a GM should always make a reaction roll when ever the PCs encounter another creature or group, whether friendly or hostile. This roll will indicate the general mood of the encounter, and whether the subjects are likely to be amenable to negotiations.

### 5.2.1 Making a Reaction Roll

To make a reaction roll, roll 2d6 and compare it to the adjacent table. If a PC is in a position to greet the targets, add their Charisma modifier to the roll.

The higher the reaction roll, the friendlier and more helpful the NPCs will be. This doesn’t mean that goblin raiders will invite the PCs to drink with them, but it does mean that otherwise violent groups might decide to demand a bribe instead, or back off rather than risk losing lives to the heroes. Conversely, a low roll means that the group is more hostile and unhelpful than they might be expected to be.

Once a roll is made, the GM should clearly clue the PCs into its general results. If the bandits are feeling sociable, the GM needs to let the players know that they’re looking relaxed and leaning on their spears. If the wild beast is getting ready to attack, it should be described as crouching and snarling as it begins to creep forward. This information needs to be given before the PCs choose their initial actions, or else a lot of potential parleys are going to be erased by the immediate and judicious drawing of swords.

A reaction roll applies to non-martial encounters as well. Determining the initial mood of a government clerk, the temper of a merchant, or the attitude of a noble patron can all be done by a reaction roll. This attitude will likely color the difficulty and nature of any negotiations or social skill checks the PCs might try to conduct with the target.

Reaction rolls are only the start of an encounter, not the end. Clever words, persuasive arguments, or prudent gifts can all shift the attitude of an NPC, as can insults, threats, and looking excessively tender and delicious. Provided the NPCs aren’t the sort to simply attack, the PCs always have a chance to salvage a meeting.

### 5.2.2 Peaceful Encounter Reactions

Suppose a GM’s just rolled a 12 for the PCs’ roadside encounter with a band of zealous blood cultists. The GM knows that the cultists are vicious but have no pressing reason to immediately attack the PCs, so what does “friendly” mean in such a situation? If you find yourself having to figure out plausible reactions for otherwise-hostile groups, here are some suggestions.

**They demand a bribe.** They’ll take money, gear, food, booze, praise to their dark god, or some other currency for peace.

**They back off.** If they aren’t defending their lair or carrying out some critical task, they may just decide to back away and keep their distance as the groups pass by. They may bring word of the adventurers to their comrades, but a fight under the present terms might look like a bad deal to them.

**They ask for favors.** Maybe they have an enemy they want killed, or a task they need done. They may trade offers of ignoring the PCs while they remain in the area in exchange for the help, or offer an outright bribe to the PCs to get them to cooperate. Even the most hostile raider group might be willing to let a few targets go in exchange for some profitable work being done.

**They offer tribute.** They’ve looked at the PCs and decided that their own lives are in danger. They’ll offer wealth, information, services, or other inducements to get the PCs to leave them alone. This reaction grows more possible if the PCs have been carving a bloody swath through their surroundings.

**They willingly socialize.** Maybe the bandits have been out here so long that they’re lonely for civilized conversation, and the PCs look too dangerous to engage. The goblin raiders might’ve mistaken them for allied marauders and invite them to share their camp. The vile necromancer might consider herself a perfectly respectable person who loves good dinner conversation. However it’s sliced, the NPC could be willing just to have a nice chat.
