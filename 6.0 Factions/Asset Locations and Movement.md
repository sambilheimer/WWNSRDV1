## 6.3.0 Asset Locations and Movement

Every Asset has a location on the campaign map.
This location may not be where all the elements of the Asset are located.
It might simply be the headquarters of an organization, or the spot where the most active and important members of it are currently working.
However it’s described, it’s the center of gravity for the Asset.

This location is usually in a town or other settlement, but it could be anything that makes sense.
A reclusive Prophet might dwell deep within the wilderness, and a ring of Smugglers might currently be based out of a hidden sea cave.
A location is simply wherever the GM thinks it should be.

Assets can move locations, either with the Move Asset faction action or with a special ability possessed by the Asset itself or an allied unit.
Generally, whenever an Asset moves, it can move one turn’s worth of distance.
As a rule of thumb, for a one-month turn, this is about one hundred miles.
This is as far as an organization can shift itself in thirty days while still maintaining some degree of control and cohesion.
The GM may adjust this distance based on the situation; if the campaign is taking place in an island archipelago with fast sea travel it’s going to be easier to move long distances than if the Asset has to march through mountains to get there.

Some Assets also have special abilities that work on targets within one move of the Asset.
Again, the GM decides what this means, but generally it means that the Asset can affect targets within a hundred miles of its location.

Sometimes it doesn’t make logical sense for an Asset to be able to move to a particular location.
A unit of Infantry, for example, could hardly walk into an enemy nation’s capital so as to later Attack the Court Patronage Asset there.
In this case, the best the Infantry could do would be to move to a location near the capital, assuming the GM decides that’s plausible.
The Infantry couldn’t actually Attack the enemy faction’s Assets until they got into the city itself where those Assets were located.

Assets with the Subtle quality are not limited this way.
Subtle Assets can move to locations even where they would normally be prohibited by the ruling powers.
Dislodging them requires that they be Attacked until destroyed or moved out by their owner.

Assets with the Stealth quality are also not limited by this, and can move freely to any location within reach.
Stealthed Assets cannot be Attacked by other Assets until they lose the Stealth quality.
This happens when they are discovered by certain special Assets or when the Stealthed Asset Attacks something.
