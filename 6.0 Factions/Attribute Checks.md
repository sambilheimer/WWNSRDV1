## 6.4.0 Attribute Checks

Some actions, such as Attack, require an attribute check between factions, such as Force versus Cunning, or Wealth versus Force.
Other special Asset abilities sometimes call for attribute checks as well.

To make this check, the attacker and defender both roll 1d10 and add their relevant attribute.
Thus, for a Force versus Cunning check, the attacker would roll 1d10+Force against the defender’s 1d10+-Cunning.
The attacker wins if their total is higher, and the defender wins if it’s a tie or their roll is higher.

Some special abilities or tags allow the attacker or defender to roll more than one die for a check.
In this case, the dice are rolled and the highest of them are used.
