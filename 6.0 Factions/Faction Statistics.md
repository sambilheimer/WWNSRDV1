## 6.1.0 Faction Statistics

**Cunning** is measured from 1 to 8 and indicates the faction’s general guile, skill at subterfuge, and subtlety.
Low Cunning means the faction is straightforward or unaccustomed to dealing with trickery, while high Cunning is for Machiavellian schemers and secretive organizations.

**Force** is measured from 1 to 8 and reflects the overall military prowess and martial competence of the faction.
A faction with low Force isn’t used to using violence to get its way, or is particularly inept at it, while a high Force reflects a culture of military expertise.

**Wealth** is measured from 1 to 8 and shows the faction’s general prosperity, material resources, and facility with money.
Low Wealth means the faction is poor, disinterested in material goods, or spend thrift with what they have, while high Wealth factions are rich and familiar with using money and goods as tools for success.

**Magic** measures the amount of magical resources available to the faction. “None” is for factions that have no meaningful access to magic. “Low” is for those factions that have at best a few trained mages or small stores of magical goods. “Medium” is for a faction where there is an established source of magical power for the faction, either as a sub-group of cooperative mages, a magical academy, a tradition of sorcery in the faction, or some other institutionalized aid. “High” magic is reserved for those factions that have a strong focus on wielding magical power, most fitting for a faction that represents a magical order.

**Treasure** is counted in points, and the total reflects how much the faction owns in cash and valuable goods.
A single point of Treasure doesn’t have an established cash value; a sack of gold is worthless in itself to a faction that needs a dozen oxcarts, and a herd of cattle owned by a faction can’t necessarily be turned into a fixed sum of coin.

**Hit points** work for factions much as they do for characters; when a faction is reduced to zero hit points, it collapses.
Its individual members and sub-groups might not all be dead, but they’re so hopelessly disorganized, dispirited, or conflict-bound that the faction ceases to exist as a coherent whole.

**Assets** are important resources possessed by a faction, such as controlling a ring of Smugglers, or having a unit of Infantry.
Assets all have their own statistics and hit points, and all of them require certain scores in Force, Wealth, Cunning, and Magic to purchase.
Assets don’t cover all the resources and institutions the faction may control, but they reflect the ones that are most relevant to the faction at that moment.
A kingdom may have more military than the Infantry unit they have, but that Infantry unit is the one that’s doing something important.
