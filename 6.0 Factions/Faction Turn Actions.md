## 6.6.0 Faction Turn Actions

**Attack:** The faction nominates one or more Assets to attack the enemy in their locations.
In each location, the defender chooses which of the Assets present will meet the Attack; thus, if a unit of Infantry attacks in a location where there is an enemy Base of Influence, Informers, and Idealistic Thugs, the defender could decide to use Idealistic Thugs to defend against the attack.

The attacker makes an attribute check based on the attack of the acting Asset; thus, the Infantry would roll Force versus Force.
On a success, the defending Asset takes damage equal to the attacking Asset’s attack score, or 1d8 in the case of Infantry.
On a failure, the attacking Asset takes damage equal to the defending Asset’s counterattack score, or 1d6 in the case of Idealistic Thugs.

If the damage done to an Asset reduces it to zero hit points, it is destroyed.
The same Asset may be used to defend against multiple attacking Assets, provided it can survive the onslaught.

Damage done to a Base of Influence is also done directly to the faction’s hit points.
Overflow damage is not transmitted, however.

**Move Asset:** One or more Assets are moved up to one turn’s worth of movement each.
The receiving location must not have the ability and inclination to forbid the Asset from operating there.
Subtle and Stealthed Assets ignore this limit.

If an asset loses the Subtle or Stealth qualities while in a hostile location, they must use this action to retreat to safety within one turn or they will take half their maximum hit points in damage at the start of the next turn, rounded up.

**Repair Asset:** The faction spends 1 Treasure on each Asset they wish to repair, fixing half their relevant attribute value in lost hit points, rounded up.
Thus, fixing a Force Asset would heal half the faction’s Force attribute, rounded up.
Additional healing can be applied to an Asset in this same turn, but the cost increases by 1 Treasure for each subsequent fix; thus, the second costs 2 Treasure, the third costs 3 Treasure, and so forth.

This ability can at the same time also be used to repair damage done to the faction, spending 1 Treasure to heal a total equal to the faction’s highest and lowest Force, Wealth, or Cunning attribute divided by two, rounded up.
Thus, a faction with a Force of 5, Wealth of 2, and Cunning of 4 would heal 4 points of damage.
Only one such application of healing is possible for a faction each turn.

**Expand Influence:** The faction seeks to establish a new base of operations in a location.
The faction must have at least one Asset there already to make this attempt, and must spend 1 Treasure for each hit point the new Base of Influence is to have.
Thus, to create a new Base of Influence with a maximum hit point total of 10, 10 Treasure must be spent.
Bases with high maximum hit point totals are harder to dislodge, but losing them also inflicts much more damage on the faction’s own hit points.

Once the Base of Influence is created, the owner makes a Cunning versus Cunning attribute check against every other faction that has at least one Asset in the same location.
If the other faction wins the check, they are allowed to make an immediate Attack against the new Base of Influence with whatever Assets they have present in the location.
The creating faction may attempt to block this action by defending with other Assets present.

If the Base of Influence survives this onslaught, it operates as normal and allows the faction to purchase new Assets there with the Create Asset action.

**Create Asset:** The faction buys one Asset at a location where they have a Base of Influence.
They must have the minimum attribute and Magic ratings necessary to buy the Asset and must pay the listed cost in Treasure to build it.
A faction can create only one Asset per turn.

A faction can have no more Assets of a particular attribute than their attribute score.
Thus, a faction with a Force of 3 can have only 3 Force Assets.
If this number is exceeded, the faction must pay 1 Treasure per excess Asset at the start of each turn, or else they will lose the excess.

**Hide Asset:** An action available only to factions with a Cunning score of 3 or better, this action allows the faction to give one owned Asset the Stealth quality for every 2 Treasure they spend.
Assets currently in a location with another faction’s Base of Influence can’t be hidden.
If the Asset later loses the Stealth, no refund is given.

**Sell Asset:** The faction voluntarily decommissions an Asset, salvaging it for what it’s worth.
The Asset is lost and the faction gains half its purchase cost in Treasure, rounded down.
If the Asset is damaged when it is sold, however, no Treasure is gained.
