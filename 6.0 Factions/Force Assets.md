## 6.9.0 Force Assets

**Apocalypse Engine:** One of a number of hideously powerful ancient super-weapons unearthed from some lost armory, an Apocalypse Engine rains some eldritch horror down on a targeted enemy Asset.

**Brilliant General:** A leader for the ages is in service with the faction.
Whenever the Brilliant General or any allied Force Asset in the same location Attacks or is made to defend, it can roll an extra die to do so.

**Cavalry:** Mounted troops, chariots, or other mobile soldiers are in service to the faction.
While weak on defense, they can harry logistics and mount powerful charges.

**Demonic Slayer:** Powerful sorcerers have summoned or constructed an inhuman assassin-beast to hunt down and slaughter the faction’s enemies.
A Demonic Slayer enters play Stealthed.

**Enchanted Elites:** A carefully-selected group of skilled warriors are given magical armaments and arcane blessings to boost their effectiveness.

**Fearful Intimidation:** Judicious exercises of force have intimidated the locals, making them reluctant to cooperate with any group that stands opposed to the faction.

**Fortification Program:** A program of organized fortification and supply caching has been undertaken around the Asset’s location, hardening allied communities and friendly Assets.
Once per turn, when an enemy makes an Attack that targets the faction’s Force rating, the faction can use the Fortification Program to defend if the Asset is within a turn’s move from the attack.

**Guerrilla Populace:** The locals have the assistance of trained guerrilla warfare leaders who can aid them in sabotaging and attacking unwary hostiles.

**Infantry:** Common foot soldiers have been organized and armed by the faction.
While rarely particularly heroic in their capabilities, they have the advantage of numbers.

**Invincible Legion:** The faction has developed a truly irresistible military organization that can smash its way through opposition with out the aid of any support units.
During a Relocate Asset action, the Invincible Legion can relocate to locations that would otherwise not permit a formal military force to relocate there, as if it had the Subtle quality.
It is not, however, in any way subtle.

**Knights:** Elite warriors of considerable personal prowess have been trained or enlisted by the faction, either from noble sympathizers, veteran members, or amenable mercenaries.

**Local Guard:** Ordinary citizens are enlisted into night watch patrols and local guard units.
They’re most effective when defending from behind a fortified position, but they have some idea of how to use their weapons.

**Magical Logistics:** An advanced web of magical Workings, skilled sorcerers, and trained logistical experts are enlisted to streamline the faction’s maintenance and sustain damaged units.
Once per faction turn, as a free action, the Asset can repair 2 hit points of damage to an allied Force Asset.

**Military Roads:** The faction has established a network of roads with a logistical stockpile at this Asset’s location.
As a consequence, once per faction turn, the faction can move any one Asset from any location within its reach to any other location within its reach at a cost of 1 Treasure.

**Military Transport:** A branch of skilled teamsters, transport ships, road-building crews, or other logistical facilitators is in service to the faction.
As a free action once per faction turn, it can bring an allied Asset to its location, provided they’re within one turn’s movement range, or move an allied Asset from its own location to a target also within a turn’s move.
Multiple Military Transport assets can chain this movement over long distances.

**Purity Rites:** A rigorous program of regular mental inspection and counterintelligence measures has been undertaken by the faction.
This Asset can only defend against attacks that target the faction’s Cunning, but it allows the faction to roll an extra die to defend.

**Reserve Corps:** Retired military personnel and rear-line troops are spread through the area as workers or colonists, available to resist hostilities as needed.

**Scouts:** Long-range scouts and reconnaissance experts work for the faction, able to venture deep into hostile territory.

**Siege Experts:** These soldiers are trained in trenching, sapping, and razing targeted structures.
When they successfully Attack an enemy Asset, the owner loses 1d4 points of Treasure from their reserves and this faction gains it.

**Summoned Hunter:** A skilled sorcerer has summoned a magical beast or mentally bound a usefully disposable assassin into the faction’s service.

**Temple Fanatics:** Fanatical servants of a cult, ideology, or larger religion, these enthusiasts wreak havoc on enemies without a thought for their own lives.
After every time the Temple Fanatics defend or successfully attack, they take 1d4 damage.

**Thugs:** These gutter ruffians and common kneebreakers have been organized in service to the faction’s causes.

**Vanguard Unit:** This unit is specially trained to build bridges, reduce fortifications, and facilitate a lightning strike into enemy territory.
When its faction takes a Relocate Asset turn, it can move the Vanguard Unit and any allied units at the same location to any other location within range, even if the unit type would normally be prohibitive from moving there.
Thus, a Force asset could be moved into a foreign nation’s territory even against their wishes.
The unit may remain at that location afterwards even if the Vanguard Unit leaves.

**War Fleet:** While a war fleet can only Attack assets and locations within reach of the waterways, once per turn it can freely relocate itself to any coastal area within movement range.
The Asset itself must be based out of some landward location to provide for supply and refitting.

**War Machines:** Mobile war machines driven by trained beasts or magical motive power are under the faction’s control.

**Warshaped:** The faction has the use of magical creatures designed specifically for warfare, or ordinary humans that have been greatly altered to serve the faction’s needs.
Such forces are few and elusive enough to evade easy detection.

**Witch Hunters:** Certain personnel are trained in sniffing out traitors and spies in the organization, along with the presence of hostile magic or hidden spellcraft.
