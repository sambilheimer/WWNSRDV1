## 6.2.0 The Faction Turn

Every month or so, the GM should run a faction turn.
This turn may take place more often during times of intense activity, or less often if the campaign world is quiet.
In general, a faction turn after every adventure is a good average, assuming the PCs don’t have back to-back adventures.

At the start of every faction turn, each faction rolls 1d8 for initiative, the highest rolls going first.
Ties are resolved as the GM wishes, and then each faction takes the following steps in order.

- The faction earns Treasure equal to half their Wealth plus a quarter of their combined Force and Cunning, the total being rounded up.
- The faction must pay any upkeep required by their individual Asset costs, or by the cost of having too many Assets for their attributes.
  If they can’t afford this upkeep, individual Assets may have their own bad consequences, while not being able to afford excess Assets means that the excess are lost.
- The faction triggers any special abilities individual Assets may have, such as abilities that allow an Asset to move or perform some other special benefit.
- The faction takes one Faction Action as listed in the following section, resolving any Attacks or other consequences from their choice.
  When an action is taken, every Asset owned by the faction may take it; thus, if Attack is chosen, then every valid Asset owned by the faction can Attack.
  If Repair Asset is chosen, every Asset can be repaired if enough Treasure is spent.
- The faction checks to see if it’s accomplished its most recent goal.
  If so, it collects the experience points for doing so and picks a new goal.
  If not, it can abandon the old goal and pick a new one, but it will sacrifice its next turn’s Faction Action to do so and may not trigger any Asset special abilities that round, either.

The next faction in order then acts until all factions have acted for the turn.
