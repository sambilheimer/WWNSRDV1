## 6.10.0 Wealth Assets

**Ancient Mechanisms:** Some useful magical mechanism from ages past has been refitted to be useful in local industry.
Whenever an Asset in the same location must roll to make a profit, such as Farmers or Manufactory, the faction may roll the die twice and take the better result.

**Ancient Workshop:** A workshop has been refitted with ancient magical tools, allowing prodigies of production, albeit not always safely.
As a free action, once per turn, the Ancient Workshop takes 1d6 damage and the owning faction gains 1d6 Treasure.

**Arcane Laboratory:** The faction’s overall Magic is counted as one step higher for the purposes of creating Assets in the same location as the laboratory.
Multiple Arcane Laboratories in the same location can increase the Magic boost by multiple steps.

**Armed Guards:** Hired caravan guards, bodyguards, or other armed minions serve the faction.

**Caravan:** As a free action, once per turn, the Caravan can spend 1 Treasure and move itself and one other Asset in the same place to a new location within one move.

**Cooperative Businesses:** If any other faction attempts to create an Asset in the same location as a Cooperative Business, the cost of doing so increases by 1 Treasure.
This penalty stacks.

**Dragomans:** Interpreters, cultural specialists, and go-betweens simplify the expansion of a faction’s influence in an area.
A faction that takes an Expand Influence action in the same location as this Asset can roll an extra die on all checks there that turn.
As a free action once per turn, this Asset can move.

**Economic Disruption:** As a free action once per turn, this Asset can move itself without cost.

**Farmers:** Farmers, hunters, and simple rural artisans are in service to the faction here.
Once per turn, as a free action, the Asset’s owner can roll 1d6; on a 5+, they gain 1 Treasure from the Farmers.

**Free Company:** Hired mercenaries and professional soldiers, this Asset can, as a free action once per turn, move itself.
At the start of each of its owner’s turn, it takes 1 Treasure in upkeep costs; if this is not paid, roll 1d6.
On a 1-3 the Asset is lost, on a 4-6 it goes rogue and will move to Attack the most profitable-looking target.
This roll is repeated each turn until back pay is paid or the Asset is lost.

**Front Merchant:** Whenever the Front Merchant successfully Attacks an enemy Asset, the target faction loses 1 Treasure, if they have any, and the Front Merchant’s owner gains it.
Such a loss can occur only once per turn.

**Golden Prosperity:** Each turn, as a free action, the faction gains 1d6 Treasure that can be used to fix damaged Assets as if by the Repair Assets action.
Any of this Treasure not spent on such purposes is lost.

**Healers:** Whenever an Asset within one move of the Healers is destroyed by an Attack that used Force against the target, the owner of the Healers may pay half its purchase price in Treasure, rounded up, to instantly restore it with 1 hit point.
This cannot be used to repair Bases of Influence.

**Hired Legion:** As a free action once per turn, the Hired Legion can move.
This faction must be paid 2 Treasure at the start of each turn as upkeep, or else they go rogue as the Free Company Asset does.
This Asset cannot be voluntarily sold or disbanded.

**Lead or Silver:** If Lead or Silver’s Attack reduces an enemy Asset to zero hit points, this Asset’s owner may immediately pay half the tar get’s purchase cost to claim it as their own, reviving it with 1 hit point.

**Mad Genius:** As a free action, once per turn, the Mad Genius may move.
As a free action, once per turn, the Mad Genius may be sacrificed to treat the Magic rating in their location as High for the purpose of buying Assets that require such resources.
This boost lasts only until the next Asset is purchased in that location.

**Manufactory:** Once per turn, as a free action, the Asset’s owner may roll 1d6; on a 1, one point of Treasure is lost, on a 2-5, one point is gained, and on a 6, two points are gained.
If Treasure is lost and none is available to pay it by the end of the turn, this Asset is lost.

**Merchant Prince:** A canny master of trade, the Merchant Prince may be triggered as a free action once per turn before buying a new Asset in the same location; the Merchant Prince takes 1d4 damage and the purchased Asset costs 1d8 Treasure less, down to a minimum of half its normal price.

**Monopoly:** Once per turn, as a free action, the Monopoly Asset can target an Asset in the same location; that Asset’s owning faction must either pay the Monopoly’s owner 1 Treasure or lose the targeted Asset.

**Occult Countermeasures:** This asset can only Attack or inflict Counterattack damage on Assets that require at least a Low Magic rating to purchase.

**Pleaders:** Whether lawyers, skalds, lawspeakers, sage elders, or other legal specialists, Pleaders can turn the local society’s laws against the enemies of the faction.
However, Pleaders can neither Attack nor inflict Counterattack damage on Force Assets.

**Smuggling Fleet:** Once per turn, as a free action, they may move themselves and any one Asset at their current location to any other water-accessible location within one move.
Any Asset they move with them gains the Subtle quality until they take some action at the destination.

**Supply Interruption:** As a free action, once per turn, the Asset can make a Cunning vs.
Wealth check against an Asset in the same location.
On a success, the owning faction must sacrifice Treasure equal to half the target Asset’s purchase cost, or else it is disabled and useless until this price is paid.

**Trade Company:** Bold traders undertake potentially lucrative- or catastrophic- new business opportunities.
As a free action, once per turn, the owner of the Asset may roll accept 1d4 damage done to the Asset in exchange for earning 1d6-1 Treasure points.

**Transport Network:** A vast array of carters, ships, smugglers, and official caravans are under the faction’s control.
As a free action the Transport Network can spend 1 Treasure to move any friendly Asset within two moves to any location within one move of either the target or the Transport Network.

**Usurers:** Moneylenders and other proto-bankers ply their trade for the faction.
For each unit of Usurers owned by a faction, the Treasure cost of buying Assets may be decreased by 2 Treasure, to a minimum of half its cost.
Each time the Usurers are used for this benefit, they suffer 1d4 damage from popular displeasure.

**Worker Mob:** The roughest, most brutal laborers in service with the faction have been quietly organized to sternly discipline the enemies of the group.
