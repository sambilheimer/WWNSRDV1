# 7.0.0 Major Projects

In any campaign, there will likely arise some occasion when the PCs take it into their heads to accomplish some great change in the world.
Perhaps they want to abolish slavery in a country, or institute a new government in a howling wilderness, or crush the economic power of a hateful merchant cartel.
The party wants to accomplish something grand or large-scale where there is no obvious direct path to success.
No single killing or specific act of heroism will get them their aim, though the goal itself isn’t so wild as to be obviously futile.

Such ambitions are major projects, and this section will cover a simple system to help the GM adjudicate their progress and success.
This system is meant to handle sprawling, ambiguous ambitions that aren’t clearly susceptible to a simple solution.
If the party wants a dead town burgomaster, then they can simply kill him.
If they want to turn his town into a major new trading nexus, something more complicated may be required.
