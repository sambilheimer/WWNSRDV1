## 7.3.0 Determining the Project Scope

Once the change’s probability is decided, the GM must identify how wide the scope of the change may be.

The more land and the more people the change affects, the harder it will be to bring it about.

A village-sized change is the smallest scale, affecting only a single hamlet or a village’s worth of people.
A city-sized change affects the population of a single city or several villages, while a regional one might affect a single barony or small province.
A kingdom-sized one affects a whole kingdom or a collection of feudal lordships, and a global change affects the entire world, or at least those parts known to the PCs.

When deciding the scope of the change, focus on how many people are going to be immediately affected by the project.
Turning a town into a trading hub might incidentally affect a significant part of a kingdom, but the immediate consequences are felt only by the residents of that town, and perhaps their closest trading partners.
The scope in that case would be simply that of a city, rather than a region.
Banishing slavery throughout a kingdom would require a kingdom-sized change, while getting it banned within some smaller feudal region would require a proportionately lesser scope.

If the PCs are trying to establish an educational institution, or a religious order, or some other sub-group meant to serve a chosen cause, the scope should be the largest general area the order can have influence in at any one time.
A very small order of warrior-monks might only have enough devotees to affect a village-sized community or problem.
An order with multiple monasteries and bases of operations throughout a kingdom might have enough muscle to affect events on a nation-wide scale.
In the same vein, a small academy might be enough to bring enlightened learning to a city, improving the lives of men and women there, but not have the reach to influence the greater region around it.
Individual warrior-monks or specific scholars might play major roles elsewhere in the setting, but the institution itself can’t rely on the certainty of being able to step into such roles.

In some cases, a PC might attempt to forge a Working or develop a specific bloodline of magical or cursed beings.
Assuming that they have the necessary tools and opportunities to achieve such a great feat, the scope should apply to the total number of people affected by the magic over its entire course of existence.
Thus, a village-sized change like this might apply to ten generations of a very small blood line, the enchantment lasting for a very long time but applying only to a few people at any one time.
It might be reproduced by special training, magical consecration, or a natural inherited bloodline.
Once the scope limit is reached, the magic can no longer be transmitted, as it has either been exhausted or the subtle shiftings of the magic have damaged it beyond repair.
Conversely, a very large scope for such a work might mean that many people are so affected, though a very large change like that would only last for a few generations before reaching the maximum affected population.
Because of such limits, many such empowered bloodlines or augmented magical traditions are very selective about adding new members.

Optionally, PCs who want to create such a magical working can fix it indefinitely, causing it to be heritable or transmissible for the indefinite future.
Such laborious workings are much more difficult than simply tying the effect to the natural flow of the magic, however, and so it costs four times more than it would otherwise.
Thus, imbuing a village of people with some magical quality that they will forever after transmit down to a similar number of heirs would count as a x8 multiplier instead of a x2 multiplier.
