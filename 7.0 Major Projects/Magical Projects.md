## 7.7.0 Magical Projects

Some projects are flatly impossible in nature, such as changing humans into some new humanoid species or creating a magical effect that covers an entire region.
These efforts are a step beyond ordinary impossibility, as they often require measures entirely beyond the physical capabilities of normal civilizations.

While exceedingly difficult, such projects are not out of the question for powerful mages who have the help of skilled adventurers.
They do require a few more steps than an ordinary project would require, however.

The heroes must create one or more Workings dedicated to enabling the change, using the guidelines given in the Magic chapter.
The scope of these Workings must be large enough to affect the scope of the change itself; if the alteration is to be done to an entire region, then a region-sized Working must be built.
Workings so large as to affect an entire kingdom are beyond the scope of modern magic, and only some special quest into the fathomless past could discover the keys to grand, world-spanning alterations.

The degree of the Working will depend on the degree of the change.
The devising of a race of humanoid creatures similar to humans but cosmetically different might be a Minor Working, while more substantial alterations will require great degrees of power.
The summoning of a river from the depths of the earth might be a Major change for a small stream, while something the size of the Amazon might be of Supreme difficulty.
