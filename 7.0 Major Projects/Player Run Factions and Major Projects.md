## 7.9.0 Player-Run Factions and Major Projects

PCs who have the friendship or control of factions can leverage them to assist in their grand plans.
A faction can assist on a project only once per faction turn, and this help counts as its action for the turn.

When a faction helps, it spends one point of Treasure and decreases the difficulty of the project by the sum total of its Wealth, Force, and Cunning attributes, down to a minimum difficulty of 1 point.
The faction can’t usually complete a major project on its own; it needs the PC or some driving personality to envision and implement the plan.
A faction needs to spend Treasure and help only once on a project to decrease the difficulty.
The difficulty reduction remains until the project is complete or the faction chooses to withdraw its support for some reason.
More than one faction can contribute its help, if they can be persuaded.

If the faction is ideally suited to the project, such as a government establishing a new political order, or a religion instituting a new cultural norm, or a thieves’ guild forming a cabal of assassins, then their attribute total is doubled for purposes of calculating the new difficulty.

If the faction is willing or forced to go to extremes in helping a project, either out of desperation or the ruthless demands of its leadership, it can commit its Assets and own institutional health to the project.
Any Asset or Base of Influence in the same location as the project can accept hit point damage to lower the difficulty; each hit point they spend lowers it by one point.
This kind of commitment is difficult to calibrate safely; at the end of the spend, each Asset or Base of Influence that contributed suffers an additional 1d4 damage.
This may be enough to destroy an Asset, or even destroy the faction itself if enough damage is done to a Base of Influence.
If the Asset is destroyed in the process of helping the project, the fallout of its collapse or exhaustion may have local consequences of its own.

If the faction is of a vastly larger scale than the project, such as a prosperous kingdom helping to construct a new border village, the entire project can be resolved in a single action.
In some cases, the GM may not even require the faction to spend any Treasure, as the expense is so small relative to its resources that it’s not worth tracking.
