## 7.1.0 Renown

The basic currency of major projects is called Renown, and it’s measured in points much like experience points.
PCs gain Renown for succeeding at adventures, building ties with the world, and generally behaving in a way to attract interest and respect from those around them.
PCs then spend Renown to accomplish the changes they want to make in the world, reflecting their own background activities and the work of cooperative allies and associates.

Each individual PC has their own Renown score.
They can spend it together with the rest of the party if they agree on the mutual focus of their interests, but a PC might also spend it on other ambitions or intermediate goals that come to mind.
It’s ultimately up to the player as to what they want to put their effort into; spending Renown reflects the kind of background work and off-screen support that the hero can bring to bear.

A GM doesn’t have to track Renown unless they intend to use the this system.
If the GM prefers to do things their own way, they can completely ignore Renown awards.
If the GM changes their mind later and wants to introduce the system, they can simply give each PC a Renown score equal to their current accumulated experience points and then track things accordingly from there.

Generally, a PC will receive one point of Renown after each adventure.
Some other activities or undertakings might win them additional bonus Renown, usually those works that increase the PC’s influence and involvement with the campaign world, and some adventures might not give them much Renown at all if they left no impression on the people around the party.
