## 2.2.0 Saving Throws

Saving throws are rolled to resist some unusual danger or chance hazard.
To make a saving throw, a person rolls 1d20 and tries to get equal or higher than their saving throw target.
Sometimes a save might have bonuses or penalties applied to the roll, but a natural roll of 1 on the die always fails the save, and a natural roll of 20 is always a success.

There are four types of saving throws.
Usually it will be obvious which type is most appropriate for a threat, but the GM can decide in marginal situations.

**Physical** saves resist exhaustion, poisons, diseases, or other bodily afflictions.
A PC’s Physical saving throw target is equal to 16 minus their character level and the highest of their Strength or Constitution modifiers.

**Evasion** saves apply when dodging explosions, avoiding traps, reacting to sudden peril, or other occasions where speed is of the essence.
A PC’s Evasion saving throw target is equal to 16 minus their character level and the highest of their Dexterity or Intelligence modifiers.

**Mental** saves apply when resisting mental attacks, insubstantial magic spells, psychological trauma, and other mental hazards.
A PC’s Mental saving throw target is equal to 16 minus their character level and the highest of their Wisdom or Charisma modifiers.

**Luck** saves are used when only blind chance can save a PC, regardless of their native abilities.
A PC’s Luck saving throw target is equal to 16 minus their character level, unmodified by their attributes.

### 2.2.1 NPC Saving Throws

NPCs have a single saving throw target equal to 15 minus half their rounded-down hit dice.
Thus, an NPC with 3 HD would have a saving throw target of 14+ for any particular hazard.
The GM may modify this in special circumstances, but it’s usually not worth tracking more closely.
